The purpose of this module was to introduce us to principal component analysis, or PCA. To complete this assignment, we learned how to:
- describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
- Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
- Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
- Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
